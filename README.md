Launch old versions of minecraft just as you remembered them.

## What is MineOnline?
MineOnline is a launcher Minecraft capable of running web applets without a browser, and redirecting web requests to a new API.

For example, if you wanted to play classic right now, you'd have no way to launch it without a lot of outdated vulnerable software and luck. And even if you pulled it off, you'd be running a stipped down version of the game, with no skins, no server authentication and no online map saving. MineOnline fixes this. The program can also run regular desktop versions of the game.

**Compatible with Java 8u261+**

## Apple Silicon Support
MineOnline supports Apple Silicon with both native and Rosetta JVMs. However, support is not perfected. The main problem is that the game library which old versions of Minecraft use (LWJGL 2) has been unsupported for a long time. For the game to run at all we are already using a community patch.
For the best experience we currently recommend running MineOnline under Rosetta. You can find a suitable Java Runtime Environment [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=macos&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk).

## For Developers
As per the license you are welcome to use the launcher code under non-commercial conditions.

I also request that forks remain up to date for security.
